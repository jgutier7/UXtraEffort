# UXtraEffort
UXtraEffort is a satirical front-end portfolio that intentionally showcases some of the worst possible design choices, highlighting what not to do when designing a website.

Through an over-complicated user signup and login page, visitors are introduced to frustrating user interface features. These are presented in an over-the-top manner to emphasize the importance of user-centered design principles.

The purpose is not to demonstrate poor design, but to illustrate the need for simplicity, clarity, and user-focused design in creating an engaging and intuitive user experience.

Features:

Clashing colors and overuse of Comic Sans font.
Incessantly moving buttons.
Overly complicated sign-up and login forms.
Remember: the aim is to educate about user experience design by illustrating its anti-patterns in an amusing and overstated way. If you find the website hard to use, that's the point!

Every aspect of UXtraEffort is a lesson in why user experience matters. It's not just about what we design, but how users interact with what we design.
